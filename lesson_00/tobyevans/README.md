## My Work hours:

When I was a full time marketing director,I started my mornings early with a gym session, then spent some time at home handling emails, reviewing campaigns, and finalizing content. I worked mostly online, typically from 9 to 6, but stayed flexible for client calls and time sensitive tasks outside those hours. During vacations, I made it a point to fully disconnect, often by heading somewhere remote.

Currently, I am enrolled full time in a 9 to 5 software engineering program called Code Differently as I transition into tech.

## My Work Routine

As a marketing director, my mornings typically began with a workout, coffee, and reviewing my task list. This routine helped me prepare mentally before diving into meetings. I found my most productive hours between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., a prime window for creative thinking, campaign planning, and managing unexpected challenges efficiently.

## How I Structured My Day as a Marketing Director

My calendar balanced strategy sessions, content reviews, and collarborative brainstorms. I reserved dedicated time for fouced work, such as writing briefs or analyzing data, while allowing flexibility for urgent requests and quick check-ins.

## How I prefer to Give and Receive Feedback

I view feedback as essential and most effective when balanced-enough to enhance the work without overwhelming it. I prefer one-on-one conversations for substantial discussions and concise notes or comments for smaller adjustments.

## How I Recharge

When I disconnect, I fully unplug, often spending time in nature where technology is minimal. It's my way of recharging creatively and mentally, allowing me to return to work refreshed and focused.
