## About Martha: 
I am a former product manager with a public health degree and 7 years of experience in the banking industry. I am navigating a career transition to ideally become a technical product manager. In my free time, I like to try new recipes, play video games, and workout. 

## How do I like to give/receive feedback?
I prefer written feedback so I can refer back to it in the future, but it's more important to me to get the feedback in real-time, so the situation is fresh in my mind.

## What's the best way to communicate with me?
I am a night owl, so I don't mind responding to messages late in the day. Written communication is best for me and my memory. I am not used to Google Chat (though I'm working on it), so email, text, or LinkedIn are generally the best ways to get in touch with me. 

## Somethings to know about me:
I am an introvert, but I can cosplay an extrovert as needed. I usually need additional time to digest information and reinforce what I've learned. Hands-on activities with visual materials is how I learn best. 

## One of my goals for the coming year:
In the next year, I want to get back to squatting over 200 lbs.

## Topics Iâ€™m always happy to talk about:
Food, powerlifting, good television, travel destinations, the neurodivergent experience. 

## Fun Facts
- I was born in Nigeria.
- I am the only girl in my family and I have 4 older brothers.
- I have leg pressed over 700 lbs.
- Both of the last two presidents were at my college graduation.
