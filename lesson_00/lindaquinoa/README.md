## Come In, We're Open

I am a natural-born night owl and am usually available on most platforms at any time — except Sundays. Mornings are quiet and slow-starting, with productivity in full bloom after 11 AM. Evenings are typically spent with family. While I may not be unavailable during these hours, response times may vary.

## How to Poke the Bear

One of my favorite phrases is: “Read the room.” Context clues and observation will aid you in navigating all types of "rooms", people and conversations.   

I firmly believe some questions really are dumb especially if they could be answered with critical thinking, a little nuance, or a quick bit of research.

I don't do passive aggressive. I operate exclusively in clear, direct, respectful communications in all areas of life.

I prefer giving and receiving feedback in person, followed by a summary via email. This keeps communication tangible and accountability clear. If a face-to-face isn’t possible, email is the next best option.
