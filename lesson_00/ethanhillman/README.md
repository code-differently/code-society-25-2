I'm unavailble in the morning I need sometime to wake up fully.*

### What’s the best way to communicate with me?
*I prefer an in person meeting than over emails and calls because I'm able to feel the energy of the person I am meeting with.
It's ok to interrupt when I have headphones on and if I don't respond just tap my shoulder you don't have to do a lot to get my attention.*

### How do I like to receive feedback?
