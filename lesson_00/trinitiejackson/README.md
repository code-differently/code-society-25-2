# How to work with Trinitie Jackson

## My work hours:

I am a night owl. However, I can be up and ready whenever the time calls for it. As long as someone gives me proper notice, I am available to work at any time. However, my usual working hours are 10 AM-10 PM. 

The best way to communicate with me is through email, but any other platform works since my phone is always with me. I prefer chats over in-person meetings, but the reverse if there is something that needs to be worked on. It is OK to interrupt me when I have headphones on as long as it is respectful, and I can get back to you later if needed.

*If I don’t respond, try:* Please email me again or direct message me on another platform. For anything that is an emergency, call me immediately.

## I'd love to help you with ____

Tarot/oracle readings, Adobe Photoshop + After Effects, crochet. 

I majored in Motion Media in college, so I had to work with Adobe a lot, especially After Effects. I usually worked with vectors and typography, credit scenes, and things of that nature. I also have a bit of background in Cinema 4D and Unreal Engine if you want to make some cool scenes/background with those.

I taught myself how to crochet and tarot/oracle readings, so I have a lot of recommendations and videos about how to go about it. I also have many tips and tool recommendations, mainly for crochet, to help make things easier. 

## What makes me grumpy?

I do not like being told things that I already know. This is sometimes very irrational of me, especially if it’s a new subject/class. I make sure to keep myself in check, but it can be hard for no reason sometimes (though getting humbled in something I think/thought I knew definitely helps). I also HATE being late to anything or something not starting around the time it says it will start, especially when I am told to arrive early. 

## How do I like to give feedback?

I like to give feedback through the “complement-sandwich” formula, both in-person and on any platforms that are being used. I would also usually try to give some type of suggestion with the feedback, so that I am not just throwing something out there with no help. 

I always try to give feedback if asked and if I know something that can help improve whatever it is.

## How do I like to receive feedback?

I like to receive feedback through emails versus in-person so that I have something to look back at and always reference. I usually would like it formatted, or I will format it in a bullet-point format, as that is the easiest way for me to digest it, as it gets straight to the point. 

I am always happy to receive feedback whenever I can, especially before a big event or a turning point. 

## One of my goals for the coming year:

One of my goals this year is to build up a network I can call and lean on, even when it may be well down the line. Another goal is to make another tapestry crochet cardigan, which is quite spicy of me, as tapestry crochet is not a joke.

## Topics I’m always happy to talk about:
Tarot/oracle, crystals, anime, books (all kinds- manga, web-novel, manhua, etc.), video games (especially FNAF and Genshin), pets, crochet, K-pop
