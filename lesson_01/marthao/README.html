            <h2 class="first-section">About Martha:</h2>
            <p>I am a former product manager with a public health degree and 7 years of experience in the banking industry. I am navigating a career transition to ideally become a technical product manager. In my free time, I like to try new recipes, play video games, and workout.</p>

            <h2>How do I like to give/receive feedback?</h2>
            <p>I prefer written feedback so I can refer back to it in the future, but it's more important to me to get the feedback in real-time, so the situation is fresh in my mind.</p>

            <h2>What's the best way to communicate with me?</h2>
            <p>I am a night owl, so I don't mind responding to messages late in the day. Written communication is best for me and my memory. I am not used to Google Chat (though I'm working on it), so email, text, or LinkedIn are generally the best ways to get in touch with me.</p>
            
            <h2>Somethings to know about me:</h2>
            <p>I am an introvert, but I can cosplay an extrovert as needed. I usually need additional time to digest information and reinforce what I've learned. Hands-on activities with visual materials is how I learn best.</p>
            
            <h2>One of my goals for the coming year:</h2>
            <p>In the next year, I want to get back to squatting over 200 lbs.</p>

            <h2>Topics Iâ€™m always happy to talk about:</h2>
            <p>Food, powerlifting, good television, travel destinations, the neurodivergent experience.</p>
            
            <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
