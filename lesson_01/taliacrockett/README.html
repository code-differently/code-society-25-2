    <h1>Hi Everyone, I'm Talia Crockett</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Previously, I was a nursing major with the interest of pediatrics. However, in May 2025, I earned my associate's degree in Information Technology at Delaware Technical Community College. I found myself interested in web development, as well as UX and UI design. I can be extremely shy and introverted, but once you get to know me, I'm a bit of a goofball.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning Styles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I tend to learn best with visual examples and hands-on experience.</li>
        <li>I tend to value solo focus time but also appreciate collaborations.</li>
        <li>I tend to benefit from structured guidance and clear expectations when learning something new.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>
        Some of my favorite hobbies:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Playing video games (RPGs, FPS, and simulator games)</li>
        <li>Watching anime and animated films</li>
        <li>Singing</li>
        <li>Reading thriller, mystery, and romance novels</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            One of my goals is to grow in both front-end and back-end technologies. Although, I'm currently more interested with design and user experience, I'm curious to learn and understand back-end logic, server-side development, and databases.
        </li>
        <li>
            Another goal is to get better at writing clean, maintainable, and functionable code. As well as improve my communication skills whether in a collaboration or providing feedback.
        </li>
        <li>
            Long-term, I hope to work at one of my favorite video game companies, such as Rockstar, Mihoyo, etc. Also, I want to create aesthetically pleasing (but functional!) projects.
        </li>
    </ul>
