<h1>How to work with Trinitie Jackson</h1>
<h2>My work hours:</h2>
<p>I am a night owl. However, I can be up and ready whenever the time calls for it. As long as someone gives me proper notice, I am available to work at any time. However, my usual working hours are 10 AM-10 PM.</p>

<p>The best way to communicate with me is through email, but any other platform works since my phone is always with me. I prefer chats over in-person meetings, but the reverse if there is something that needs to be worked on. It is OK to interrupt me when I have headphones on as long as it is respectful, and I can get back to you later if needed.</p>

<p><em>If I don’t respond, try:</em> Please email me again or direct message me on another platform. For anything that is an emergency, call me immediately.</p>

<h2>I'd love to help you with ____</h2>

<p>Tarot/oracle readings, Adobe Photoshop + After Effects, crochet.</p>

<p>I majored in Motion Media in college, so I had to work with Adobe a lot, especially After Effects. I usually worked with vectors and typography, credit scenes, and things of that nature. I also have a bit of background in Cinema 4D and Unreal Engine if you want to make some cool scenes/background with those.</p>

<p>I taught myself how to crochet and tarot/oracle readings, so I have a lot of recommendations and videos about how to go about it. I also have many tips and tool recommendations, mainly for crochet, to help make things easier.</p>

<h2>What makes me grumpy?</h2>

<p>I do not like being told things that I already know. This is sometimes very irrational of me, especially if it’s a new subject/class. I make sure to keep myself in check, but it can be hard for no reason sometimes (though getting humbled in something I think/thought I knew definitely helps). I also HATE being late to anything or something not starting around the time it says it will start, especially when I am told to arrive early.</p>

<h2>How do I like to give feedback?</h2>

<p>I like to give feedback through the “complement-sandwich” formula, both in-person and on any platforms that are being used. I would also usually try to give some type of suggestion with the feedback, so that I am not just throwing something out there with no help.</p>

<p>I always try to give feedback if asked and if I know something that can help improve whatever it is.</p>

<h2>How do I like to receive feedback?</h2>

<p>I like to receive feedback through emails versus in-person so that I have something to look back at and always reference. I usually would like it formatted, or I will format it in a bullet-point format, as that is the easiest way for me to digest it, as it gets straight to the point.</p>

<p>I am always happy to receive feedback whenever I can, especially before a big event or a turning point.</p>
