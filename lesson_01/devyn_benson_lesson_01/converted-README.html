    <h2>Devyn Benson</h2>
<h3>My work hours:</h3>
<p>I typically start my days with course work, training, or watching videos/podcasts, whether that&#39;s a morning/evening workout, diving into more knowledge in tech, or staying up to date with NBA/NFL/NCAAF/NCAAM. My working hours for technical tasks are usually <strong>9:00 AM–5:00 PM ET</strong>, I&#39;m most responsive to Slack <strong><a href="mailto:dxbenson252@gmail.com">dxbenson252@gmail.com</a></strong> and email as well (<strong><a href="mailto:dxbenson252@gmail.com">dxbenson252@gmail.com</a> or <a href="mailto:bensondevyn@gmail.com">bensondevyn@gmail.com</a></strong>). Early mornings and late evenings are often filled with classes, working (lifting or grinding on the computer), hanging with friends, and spending time with family. When I&#39;m on break or if something urgent comes up outside of these windows, reach out and I&#39;ll respond as quickly as I can.</p>
<h3>What’s the best way to communicate with me?</h3>
<p>I prefer Slack for quick questions and routine updates. If your message requires detailed context or attachments, send me an email and I&#39;ll make time to respond thoughtfully. For brainstorming or complex discussions, I’m a big fan of in‑person or video chats — they help build understanding and camaraderie. If I don’t get back to you right away, a follow‑up email or Slack ping is absolutely fine; when I&#39;m travelling, working, or networking at events, notifications can slip through.</p>
<h3>I’d love to help you with …</h3>
<p>Thanks to my Computer Science coursework and professional experience, I’m excited about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building and refining full‑stack systems</strong> using Rust, Python, C, Java and other languages.</li>
<li><strong>Developing automated tests and human‑centered API documentation</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Planning and executing events</strong>, from brainstorming and budgeting to volunteer coordination and partnership outreach.</li>
<li><strong>Mentoring others on leadership, communication skills and academic success</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What makes me grumpy?</h3>
<p>Ambiguity and disorganization. I thrive on clear goals and well‑structured meetings; repeated indecision or last‑minute changes make work harder for everyone. I also believe in being on time — whether that&#39;s a meeting, a deadline, or a basketball game (I used to be an athlete 🏀)</p>
<h3>How do I like to give feedback?</h3>
<p>For big‑picture topics like project direction or career growth, I prefer to talk face‑to‑face or via video to ensure we’re on the same page. Smaller items often get captured in comments or quick Slack messages, and I try to document to‑dos in shared project tools so they don’t get lost. Celebrating wins is important, so expect to hear from me when things go well!</p>
<h3>How do I like to receive feedback?</h3>
<p>Anytime, in any format. Slack or email are totally fine if that’s most comfortable, and written feedback is helpful for me to refer back to later. I appreciate honesty and timeliness; addressing issues early helps me improve and keeps projects running smoothly.</p>
<h3>One of my goals for the coming year:</h3>
<p>I&#39;m heading into life post graduation, so now after completing my Computer Science BA, I intend on deepening my software engineering expertise, growing network, and getting into the tech industry are my top priorities. As I am in this transition I continue to seek a full‑time tech engineering role or dat analytics role after graduation.</p>
<h3>Topics I’m always happy to talk about:</h3>
<p>Video games, algorithms, tech mentorship for under‑represented students (or mentorship for men and womeen of color), community engagement, sports strategy and analytics, and full‑stack development best practices.</p>
<h3>Other things you might want to know:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Major &amp; Graduation:</strong> Computer Science, expected May 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Rust, Python, C, Java, C++, Google Cloud Platform, APIs, R and HTML.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership &amp; Service:</strong> Assistant Director of Senior Events at Vassar, Leadership and Facilitation Fellow with Brothers@ mentoring program, and Captain of the Men’s Basketball Team.</li>
<li><strong>Volunteer Work:</strong> Malcolm X Park Spring Cleanup Initiative and Back‑to‑School Co‑Ed Summer Camp.</li>
<li><strong>Extracurricular Interests:</strong> Basketball, Community Mentorship, Student Advocacy, Bowling, Darts, Lifting, and Board/Card Games</li>
