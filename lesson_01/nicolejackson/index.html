      <h2 class="line-break">Introduction</h2>
      
       
      <p>
        I am embarking on the journey of becoming a software engineer with a unique set of experiences
        and circumstances that have somehow led me back to this path after almost 30 years to finish the
        thing that I started but did not complete. And I am excited!

      <h2 class="line-break">Work Hours &amp; Best Way To Communicate With Me</h2>
      
      <p>
        I intend to get my work done between 9am and 5pm, although I expect to work outside of these
        hours to complete homework and conduct research. For the purposes of this cohort, I will make
        myself available during the week until 7:30pm if anyone needs to contact me. After 7:30, I hope
        to give my undivided attention to my family and hopefully have a few minutes to myself by the end
        of the day.
      </p>
      <p>The best ways to communicate with me are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Email</strong>: as a means to share detailed information with me.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Chat</strong>: great for quick updates.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Meets</strong>: an excellent option for scheduling meetings when a face-to-face is not possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Phone call</strong>: for a direct, real-time response.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I check my email often and will reach back out to you shortly after. I have no problem with quick
        in-person chats related to work and/or projects.

      <h2 class="line-break">What I'd Love To Help You With</h2>
     
      <p>
        It would be my pleasure to help you with any of the concepts we are tackling as I grasp them
        myself. I am not sure which aspects of this work will come with ease for me, but I love to share
        as I learn and grow. As I know from experience, helping others with ideas or concepts that I have
        obtained strengthens my understanding of those very same ideas.
        So as I am able to help you in whatever capacity I can, in that interaction, you are also helping me.

      <h2 class="line-break">One Of My Goals For The Coming Year</h2>
    
      <p>
        My biggest goal for 2025 is to reach the end of the Code Differently 25.2 cohort with all of the
        skills outlined in the course syllabus. Over the last 2 months, I have rearranged things in my
        life to make room for this endeavor, and I will be extremely proud of myself to see this goal to fruition.

    <section>
      <h2 class="line-break">A Topic I Am Always Happy to Talk About</h2>
    
      <p>
        <strong>Reading.</strong> I love to read books. I am old school, so my preference is to have a physical
        book in hand as opposed to online reading from a screen or having my books read to me in audiobooks.
        I co-founded a book club during the pandemic and since its inception we have read over 30 books.
        In addition to book club books, I also have a running list of titles that I tackle independently.
        For a long time, I gravitated to biographies, autobiographies, and self-help books. My book club
        interactions have exposed me to different genres that I now enjoy. It is amazing just how much a
        good writer can convey between the front and back ends of a book.
