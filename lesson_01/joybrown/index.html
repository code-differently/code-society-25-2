  <h2>🕘 Availability &amp; Work Style</h2>

    <li>I’m a <strong>morning person</strong>—I like to knock out my most important tasks early in the day.<br /></li>
    <li>I prefer <strong>in-person meetings</strong> over chat when possible.</li>
    <li>Feel free to <strong>interrupt me</strong>, just give me a <strong>heads-up first</strong>.</li>
    <li>If I can't assist you right away, please try another team member first. If no one’s available, feel free to <strong>reach out to me on my personal number</strong>.</li>

    <li>I'm generally responsive during work hours, but I appreciate some heads-up for anything time-sensitive.</li>
