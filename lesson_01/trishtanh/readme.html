    <h2>This is how to work with Trishtan Husser</h2>
    <hr>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>My name is Trishtan Sapphire Husser. I was born and raised in Wilmington, Delaware, a city that shaped much of who I am today. I'm the second oldest of five siblings, so I’ve learned how to collaborate, compromise, and lead from a young age. Family has always played an important role in my life.</p>
<h3>My work hours:</h3>
<p>Depending on the day, I can be either a morning person or a night owl, it really varies. However, I tend to do my best work during the day when my energy is highest and I feel most focused. I am unavailable on Sundays, as I reserve that day to relax, recharge, and spend quality time with my family. That break helps me return to the workweek refreshed and ready to give my best.</p>
<h3>Communication is key:</h3>
<p>Clear communication is essential to any successful collaboration, and I take it seriously. My preferred method of contact is email, which I check regularly and respond to promptly. I prefer virtual meetings for initial contact, as they allow me to stay focused and organized. If I’m wearing headphones, please hold off on interrupting. I might be in the middle of a breakthrough and need uninterrupted time to finish my thought.</p>
<p>If you’ve emailed me and haven’t received a timely response, and it’s urgent, you’re welcome to follow up with a phone call or text message.</p>
<h3>What makes me grumpy?</h3>
<p>I get frustrated when people constantly complain without offering or seeking solutions. Complaints without action can slow down progress and affect team morale. I believe that every problem has a potential solution if we stay open and work together. Let’s focus on being proactive and supportive as we tackle challenges.</p>
<h3>How do I like to give feedback?</h3>
<p>I'm flexible when it comes to giving feedback and want it to be as helpful as possible. I’m happy to adapt my style based on what you’re most comfortable with. Just let me know how you prefer to receive feedback, and I’ll do my best to accommodate. My goal is to support your growth, not hinder it.</p>
<h3>How do I like to receive feedback?</h3>
<p>I prefer to receive feedback via email. It gives me the opportunity to revisit the comments whenever needed and track my progress. Having a written record is really helpful for reflection and improvement.</p>
<h3>One of my goals for the coming year:</h3>
<p>One of my main goals this year is to expand my tech portfolio. I want to take on new projects, sharpen my skills, and showcase my growth. This will help me stay competitive and open up new opportunities.</p>
<h3>Fun facts about me:</h3>
