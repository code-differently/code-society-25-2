# Markdown Conversion Script

## Introduction

In this README, I explain how I created an script that takes a Markdown file and converts it into a HTML file.

## My thought initial thought process

Prior to writing any code I wanted a outlook on how I wanted to achieve my objective. I thought about some tools I could use and instally thought of utilizing python. I have a very brief history with python and knew I could create a function that accepts arguments.

## Correct locations and folders

I made sure I was in the right directory and had my folders named correctly so the path way to files is correct and efficient.

## The Code

The script works by using the command line to take two arguemnts. The input markdown file and the name of the output file(That file can be named anything). The contents of the markdown file will be read and written into a new html file with the same content.
