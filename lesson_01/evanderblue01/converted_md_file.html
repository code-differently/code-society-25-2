<h2>How do I learn?</h2>
<p>I am a visual and kinesthetic learner. I retain information a lot more effectively by seeing something be done first, then physically doing it myself. Demos help me out a lot, that's why Youtube is my favorite teacher. </p>
<h2>One of my goals next year</h2>
<p>A goal I have for next year is to take a trip to the West Coast of the United States. The farthest I've traveled west so far is Texas, so exploring states like California, Oregon, or Washington would be a brand new experience for me. There's a lot of culture, natural beauty, and history on that end of the country that I’d love to immerse myself in. From iconic cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles to the stunning coastal views along Highway 1, I want to see it all. I'm especially interested in visiting historical landmarks, trying regional foods, and learning more about the diverse communities that live there. It’s not just about sightseeing, it’s about gaining a broader perspective and making unforgettable memories along the way.</p>
