    <h1>Jonee McKellar README</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I am a curious and passionate individual who is brand new to the world of tech and coding! I'm eager to build on my foundational knowledge and am looking forward to exploring different aspects of programming as I grow and build new projects.</p>

    <h2>Essentials</h2>
    <p>Here are a few things that I need in order to make the most of this amazing opportunity:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Direct, clear, and honest feedback and communication.</li>
        <li>Brain breaks that involve a change of scenery or some physical movement after being in a single space for a prolonged period of time.</li>
        <li>Written instructions.</li>
        <li>At least 6 hours of sleep at night.</li>
        <li>Time to enjoy my food. I love vegetarian meals and snacks.</li>
        <li>Lots and lots of water. Preferably Saratoga or something with a ph higher than 7 or from a glass bottle</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Work Hours</h2>
    <p>I am available during the bootcamp hours of 9 am - 5 pm. I can also be reached afterwards from 7:30 pm - 9:30 pm.</p>

    <h2>How to Reach Me</h2>
    <p>My preferred methods of communication are by email, text message, or phone call. I prefer email and text for information that I may need to reference later. </p>
    <p>I also enjoy socializing so I am always open to in person face to face conversations.</p>
    <p>Expect a follow-up text or email from me after phone or in-person conversations to confirm any important details if necessary.</p>

    <h2>I'd Love to Help You With __________</h2>
    <p>Any and everything! I am a novice who is still learning how to do things myself but I am willing to help in any ways that I can.</p>
    <p>I love decorating, styling, designing, and making things pretty. So, if you need help with making something look visually appealing or cohesive I can definitely help with that.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Me Grumpy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I do not appreciate feeling like I am being ignored or overlooked.</li>
        <li>I am no fan of gossip. Please keep any negativity or drama far away from me.</li>
        <li>I thrive in environments that have clear directions and expectations. I do not like wasting time trying to read between the lines or figuring out what is supposed to be happening.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How I Like to Give/Receive Feedback</h2>
    <p>I am always open to giving and or receiving feedback.</p>
    <p>I like to give and receive feedback in person or via email depending on the situation. </p>
    <p>I believe that feedback should be constructive including both the positives and the negatives and not just focus on one aspect.</p>
    <p>After giving/receiving feedback sometimes a follow up check in may be necessary.</p>

    <h2>One of My Goals for the Upcoming Year</h2>
