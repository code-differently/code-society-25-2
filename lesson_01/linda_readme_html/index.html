        <h1>Linda Quinoa</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Linda has nearly a decade of experience in Human Resources for local government and has developed a nuanced understanding of how systems work (and how they often don’t). Her strength lies in her soft skills, which help her navigate a wide range of people, policies, and workplace challenges with empathy and clarity. Linda aims to be a reliable resource and a steady hand in the chaos.</p>

            <h2>Come In, We're Open</h2>
            <p>I am a natural-born night owl and am usually available on most platforms at any time — except Sundays. Mornings are quiet and slow-starting, with productivity in full bloom after 11 AM. Evenings are typically spent with family. While I may not be unavailable during these hours, response times may vary.</p>

            <h2>BatPhones (Best Way to Reach)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Email is always best.</li>
                <li>In-person conversations should be followed up with an email.</li>
                <li>Email and chat notifications are received in real time — expect fast replies!</li>
                <li>Double contact is never annoying — especially if something's urgent.</li>
                <li>For emergencies: call</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Poke the Bear</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite phrases is: “Read the room.” Context clues and observation will aid you in navigating all types of "rooms", people and conversations.</p>
            <p>I firmly believe some questions really are dumb especially if they could be answered with critical thinking, a little nuance, or a quick bit of research.</p>
            <p>I don't do passive aggressive. I operate exclusively in clear, direct, respectful communications in all areas of life.</p>

            <h2>Send / Receive Feedback</h2>
            <p>I prefer giving and receiving feedback in person, followed by a summary via email. This keeps communication tangible and accountability clear. If a face-to-face isn’t possible, email is the next best option.</p>
