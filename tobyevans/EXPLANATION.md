# Prime Implementations: Python vs JavaScript

Both implementations solve the same problem using the same optimized algorithm: reject values below 2, handle small divisors (2 and 3), then test only numbers of the form 6k±1 up to √n. This approach keeps the time complexity near O(√n) while skipping obviously composite candidates.

The key similarities are structure and control flow. Both versions check input type, handle edge cases, compute a square-root bound, and loop with a step pattern. The differences are language-specific: Python uses `def`, type hints, `math.isqrt`, and raises `TypeError`, while JavaScript uses `function`, `Number.isInteger`, `Math.sqrt`, and strict equality (`===`). Python booleans are `True`/`False`, JavaScript uses `true`/`false`. Error handling differs slightly, but algorithmic behavior and performance are effectively identical.
