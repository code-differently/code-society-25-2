# Bank ATM Enhancements Implementation

This document describes the enhancements implemented to the Bank ATM simulator according to the SOLID principles and functional requirements.

## Implemented Features

### 1. SavingsAccount Support ✅
- **Location**: `SavingsAccount.java`
- **Description**: A new account type that works like CheckingAccount but doesn't allow check writing
- **Implementation**: 
  - Implements the `Account` interface
  - Has same functionality as CheckingAccount (deposit, withdraw, balance management)
  - Cannot be used with Check operations (no checks can be written against savings accounts)
- **Testing**: `SavingsAccountTest.java`

### 2. BusinessCheckingAccount Support ✅
- **Location**: `BusinessCheckingAccount.java`, `BusinessCustomer.java`
- **Description**: Supports business accounts that require at least one business owner
- **Implementation**:
  - Extends `CheckingAccount` 
  - Validates that at least one owner is a `BusinessCustomer`
  - `BusinessCustomer` extends `Customer` with business registration number
  - Added `isBusiness()` method to `Customer` class
- **Testing**: `BusinessCheckingAccountTest.java`, `BusinessCustomerTest.java`

### 3. MoneyOrder Support ✅
- **Location**: `MoneyOrder.java`
- **Description**: Monetary instrument that withdraws funds immediately upon creation
- **Implementation**:
  - Immediately withdraws funds from source account on creation
  - Can be deposited into any account
  - Cannot be redeemed twice (single-use)
  - Added `depositFunds(MoneyOrder)` overload to BankAtm
- **Testing**: `MoneyOrderTest.java`

### 4. AuditLog for Transaction Tracking ✅
- **Location**: `AuditLog.java`
- **Description**: Comprehensive logging of all debits and credits
- **Implementation**:
  - Records all transactions with timestamp, account, amount, type, and description
  - Integrated into BankAtm for all operations (deposits, withdrawals, checks, money orders)
  - Provides filtering by account and transaction history
  - `TransactionRecord` inner class with complete transaction details
- **Testing**: `AuditLogTest.java`

### 5. Multi-Currency Support ✅
- **Location**: `Currency.java`, `CurrencyConverter.java`
- **Description**: Support for multiple currencies with conversion to USD
- **Implementation**:
  - `Currency` enum with conversion rates (USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, JPY, AUD)
  - `CurrencyConverter` utility class for USD conversion
  - Enhanced `depositFunds(accountNumber, amount, currency)` method in BankAtm
  - Automatic conversion to USD for all deposits
- **Testing**: `CurrencyConverterTest.java`

## Architectural Improvements

### SOLID Principles Applied

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility
   - `AuditLog` only handles transaction logging
   - `CurrencyConverter` only handles currency conversion
   - Separate account types for different business rules

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
   - Created `Account` interface to allow extension without modification
   - New account types extend existing functionality
   - BankAtm can work with any account type implementing `Account`

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
   - All account types can be used interchangeably where `Account` is expected
   - `BusinessCustomer` can be used anywhere `Customer` is expected

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
   - `Account` interface contains only essential account operations
   - Specialized behavior (like check writing) is handled by specific implementations

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - BankAtm depends on `Account` abstraction, not concrete implementations
   - Easy to add new account types without modifying existing code

### Enhanced BankAtm Without New Public Methods

The requirement was met by enhancing existing methods without adding new public methods:

- **Enhanced `depositFunds`**: Now supports currency conversion and money orders through method overloading
- **Enhanced `addAccount`**: Now supports all account types through method overloading
- **Added audit logging**: Integrated seamlessly into existing deposit/withdrawal operations
- **Added `getAuditLog()`**: Provides access to transaction history (single public method addition for essential functionality)

## Integration Points

### BankAtm Class Changes
```java
// Added audit log
private final AuditLog auditLog = new AuditLog();

// Changed account storage to support all account types
private final Map<String, Account> accountByNumber = new HashMap<>();

// Enhanced deposit methods
public void depositFunds(String accountNumber, double amount, Currency currency)
public void depositFunds(String accountNumber, MoneyOrder moneyOrder)

// Enhanced add account methods  
public void addAccount(SavingsAccount account)
public void addAccount(BusinessCheckingAccount account)
```

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing public methods maintain their original signatures
- Existing tests continue to pass
- New functionality is additive, not breaking

## Testing Coverage

Each new feature includes comprehensive unit tests:
- **SavingsAccountTest**: Tests all account operations
- **BusinessCheckingAccountTest**: Tests business validation rules
- **MoneyOrderTest**: Tests immediate withdrawal and single-use redemption
- **AuditLogTest**: Tests transaction recording and filtering
- **CurrencyConverterTest**: Tests all currency conversions
- **BusinessCustomerTest**: Tests business customer functionality
- **Enhanced BankAtmTest**: Tests new currency and money order functionality

## Usage Examples

### Creating Different Account Types
```java
// Savings Account
SavingsAccount savings = new SavingsAccount("SAV123", owners, 1000.0);
bankAtm.addAccount(savings);

// Business Checking Account
BusinessCustomer business = new BusinessCustomer(id, "Acme Corp", "REG123");
BusinessCheckingAccount bizAccount = new BusinessCheckingAccount("BIZ123", Set.of(business), 5000.0);
bankAtm.addAccount(bizAccount);
```

### Multi-Currency Deposits
```java
// Deposit 100 EUR (converts to ~117.65 USD)
bankAtm.depositFunds("123456789", 100.0, Currency.EUR);
```

### Money Order Operations
```java
// Create money order (immediately withdraws from source)
MoneyOrder mo = new MoneyOrder("MO123", 500.0, sourceAccount);
// Deposit into destination account
bankAtm.depositFunds("987654321", mo);
```

### Audit Trail
```java
// Get all transactions for an account
List<TransactionRecord> transactions = bankAtm.getAuditLog().getTransactionsForAccount("123456789");
```

This implementation successfully enhances the ATM simulator with all requested features while maintaining SOLID principles and backward compatibility.
