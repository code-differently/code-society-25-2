# Lesson 05 Pre-Work (Toby Evans)

- Verified toolchain:
  - Python: `python3 --version`
  - Node.js: `node --version`
- Reviewed example in `anthonydmays/` for structure and expectations.
- Implemented prime checkers in Python and JavaScript using √n bound and 6k±1 optimization.
- Wrote a 100+ word comparison write-up in `tobyevans/EXPLANATION.md`.
- Ran quick sanity tests for both implementations (see commands below).

## Run commands
- Python: `python3 tobyevans/python/is_prime.py`
- JavaScript (Node): `node tobyevans/javascript/isPrime.js`

Pre-work complete.
