# README.md User Stories for Travlers

1. As a travler, I wannt to be able to list and give my opinion about places I visited, so I can share my experiences about them.

2. As a travler, I want to be able to record a conversation of someone speaking in foreign language and have it translate as they speak, so I can know what they're saying as they're saying it.

3. As a travler, I want to be able to get a list of laws of the different places I'm in, so I don't break any laws that I'm not aware of.
