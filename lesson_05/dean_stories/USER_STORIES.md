# NFL Sports Betting and Fantasy Football App User Stories 

1. As a fantasy football team owner, I need AI-driven, personalized lineup and trade recommendations (including identification of undervalued players) that account for league scoring, player performance, projections, and injuries so I can optimize my roster each week.

2. As a sports bettor, I need AI-powered betting recommendations and outcome predictions that combine historical data and real-time game information so I can make more informed bets.

3. As a bettor, I need AI-driven, real-time odds adjustments and in-play analysis based on live events (injuries, momentum shifts) so I can place timely bets with up-to-date information.

4. As a bettor and fantasy football user, I need real-time score and stat updates plus customizable notifications about games, odds, and player news so I can respond quickly during matchups.

5. As a customer, I need a simple, intuitive, and mobile-responsive interface that allows easy navigation between betting and fantasy features, personalization of preferences, and a feedback mechanism that evaluates suggested bets/lineups.

6. As a league commissioner, I need robust league-management tools (custom scoring, trade and waiver workflows, standings, playoff brackets, and in-app communication) so I can efficiently run and moderate the league.

7. As a platform operator, I need compliance and safety features—age and identity verification, responsible-gambling tools (deposit limits, self-exclusion), and fraud detection—to meet regulations and protect users and the business.

8. As a product team, I need a scalable technical foundation (React + Next.js + Tailwind UI, maps/geolocation, and a database to store bets/lineups/data usage) plus analytics and integration points so we can deliver performant, extensible features and surface insights to users.
