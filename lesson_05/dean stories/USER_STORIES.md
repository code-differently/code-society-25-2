# User Stories (Condensed to 8 — Generic)

1. As a roster manager, I need AI-driven personalized lineup and trade recommendations (including identification of undervalued participants) that account for scoring rules, performance, projections, and availability so I can optimize my roster each week.

2. As a platform user seeking predictions, I need AI-powered outcome predictions that combine historical data and current information so I can make more informed decisions.

3. As a decision-maker acting during events, I need AI-driven, real-time adjustments to odds or metrics based on live events (e.g., injuries, momentum) so I can act on the most up-to-date information.

4. As a participant, I need real-time score and statistic updates plus customizable notifications about events and participant status so I can respond quickly during matchups.

5. As a user, I need a simple, intuitive, and mobile-responsive interface with personalization and a feedback mechanism that evaluates suggested actions (bets, lineups, or moves).

6. As an organizer, I need robust management tools (configurable rules, trade/waiver workflows, standings, brackets, and in-app communication) to efficiently run and moderate competitions.

7. As an operator, I need compliance and safety features—identity verification, responsible-use controls (limits, self-exclusion), and fraud detection—to meet regulations and protect users and the platform.

8. As a development team, we need a scalable technical foundation (React, Next.js, Tailwind, geolocation integration, and a database for storing data) plus analytics and integration points to deliver performant, extensible features and surface insights.
