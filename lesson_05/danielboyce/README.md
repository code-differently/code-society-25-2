As a customer I want to be able to search for any product I want so I don't have to go to multiple different sites and stores creating a super convient app/site

As a vendor I want to be able to sell any item I choose on Amazon so that I can so more people will buy it and I will make more money.

As a customer I want to have a shoppping cart to add multiple items so that I can continue shopping without checking out everytime or save an item for a later purchase.
