# The Astral Compass 
This is a fictional system for a fantasy nation that my friends and I created a while back, called the Mayou Kuni.

## User Story 1

***As a*** space pilot, ***I want*** the system to calculate the fastest and safest route ***so that*** I avoid hazards like asteroid fields or black holes.
### Acceptance Criteria
- If a hazard is detected, the system issues an audible and visual alert ASAP.
- The alert identifies the hazard type, like an Asteroid Belt, Enemy Territory, etc.
- The system highlights the hazard location on the compass map.
- If no safe alternative exists, the system displays a warning that the risk is unavoidable.

## User Story 2 (with a fantasy twist)

***As a*** navigator, ***I want*** to align my course with favorable star constellations ***so that*** my journey is blessed and protected.
### Acceptance Criteria
- Navigation map shows constellation alignments for the chosen route.
- Navigator can toggle "favorable path” view.
- If alignment is poor, system recommends an alternate departure time/route.
- Alignments are based on dynamic celestial cycles and updated daily.

## User Story 3

***As a*** ship engineer, ***I want*** the system to calculate fuel and supply requirements for a plotted route ***so that*** I can prepare the ship properly.
### Acceptance Criteria
- When a course is plotted, the system displays estimated fuel and supply needs.
- System shows real-time impact of changes.
- If the power setup could damage the system, the system gives a warning.
- Engineer can increase or decrease power to engines, shields, or weapons individually.

## Definition of “done”
- Test coverage meets the team’s agreed threshold.
- All Acceptance Criteria are met.
- Feature integrates with existing ship systems (navigation map, engineering console, pilot display).
- Alerts, warnings, and logs appear in the correct locations.
- Feature has been tested in simulation (normal conditions, hazardous conditions, emergencies).
