## 1) ChatGPT-5 — Tailored Applications on Tap
-------------------------------------------

**User story:** As a **job seeker breaking into AI/GTM**, I want **ChatGPT-5 to auto-tailor my resume and pitch to a target JD**, so that **I can apply fast and confidently with proof-based bullets**.

**Acceptance criteria**

*   I can upload a **JD (PDF/link)** and my **resume** in one flow.
    
*   The assistant returns:
    
    *   3–5 **tailored bullets** mapped to the JD’s must-haves (keep skill keywords intact).
        
    *   A **90-sec pitch** and a **cover note** draft.
        
    *   A short **gap report** (what’s missing + 1 action to close each gap).
        
*   I can toggle **voice/tone** (concise, technical, GTM, friendly).
    
*   Outputs come with a **diff view** against my original resume.
    
*   No PII is stored by default; export as **Markdown** and **PDF**.
    

**Notes**

*   Scope: content generation + alignment, not job-board submission.
    
*   Nice-to-have: one-click **Loom script** for a quick portfolio video.
    

## 2) _The Last of Us_ — Accessible Listen Mode+
---------------------------------------------

**User story:** As a **player who relies on accessibility features**, I want **an enhanced Listen Mode that surfaces enemies, allies, and loot with clear audio/visual cues**, so that **stealth and scavenging stay playable without eye strain or perfect hearing**.

**Acceptance criteria**

*   Toggle **Listen Mode+** in Accessibility settings.
    
*   When active:
    
    *   **Enemies** pulse with a subtle outline; **allies** use a different pattern.
        
    *   **Lootables/crafting parts** ping within 10 meters with a distinct tone.
        
    *   Cues scale with **difficulty** (fewer hints on higher modes).
        
*   Works during **combat and exploration**; never blocks narrative subtitles.
    
*   Remappable intensity (low/med/high) and **color-blind–safe palettes**.
    

**Notes**

*   Aligns with Naughty Dog’s accessibility ethos; clarifies state without trivializing stealth.
    

## 3) _Temple Run_ — Daily Sprint Mode
-----------------------------------

**User story:** As a **commuter with 1 minute to play**, I want **a 60-second “Daily Sprint” run with a clean score and a quick retry**, so that **I can get a hit of play without a long session**.

**Acceptance criteria**

*   New **Daily Sprint** button on the home screen.
    
*   Fixed **60-sec timer**; score = distance × coin multiplier.
    
*   One **free retry** per day; best score saved to a **daily leaderboard**.
    
*   Survives interruptions (calls, app switch) via **auto-pause**; resumes once.
    
*   Standard swipe/tilt controls; **no ads** during the sprint.
    

**Notes**

*   Keeps the endless-runner feel while giving a snackable session.
