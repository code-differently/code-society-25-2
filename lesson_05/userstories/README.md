# Real Time Translation App

## Overview
I wanted to base my user stories around an app that would make translating languages in real time easier for conversations and studying (this probably already exists).


## User Story #1
1. As a traveler, I want to be able to record a conversation of someone speaking in a different language and translate it in real time, so I can communicate with people who might need help.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Audio Recording Functionality: The app must provide a clear record button that captures audio input with visual feedback during recording.
- Real-Time Translation: Translation processing should begin within a few seconds and display accurate text in the target language.
- Audio Playback: The app should convert translated text to speech and play it aloud in the target language.
- Multiple recordings in sequence: Users should be able to record multiple conversations back-to-back for ongoing dialogue.


## User Story #2
2. As a foreigner, I want to take a picture of a language and have it translated in real time so that I can avoid dealing with language barriers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Camera Integration: The app must provide a camera button that allows users to capture photos of text with proper focus and lighting guidance.
- Text Recognition: The app should detect and extract text from images using OCR technology within a few seconds of capture.
- Visual Translation Display: Translated text should appear overlaid on the original image or in a clear display format below the photo.
- Multiple Text Languages: The app should support translation of common languages found on signs, menus, and documents while traveling.




## User Story #3
3. As a student, I want to store the previous translations that I've done on the app so that I can look back at them at a later date and study them.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Translation History Storage: The app must automatically save all completed translations with timestamps and source/target language pairs.
- Easy Access to Saved Translations: Users should be able to access their translation history through a clearly labeled menu or tab within the app.
- Search and Filter Functionality: The app should allow users to search through their saved translations by date, language, or keywords from the original text.
- Study Mode Features: Saved translations should display both original and translated text side-by-side for effective language learning and review.
