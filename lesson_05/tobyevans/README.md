# Lesson 05 – User Stories (Toby Evans)

## Product: Smart Home Automation System

1) As a homeowner, I want to create room-based scenes (e.g., “Movie Night”) so that multiple devices adjust with one tap.  
2) As a user, I want to schedule devices like lights and the thermostat so that energy use decreases automatically when I’m away.  
3) As a parent, I want guest profiles with limited permissions so visitors can control lights but not security cameras.
