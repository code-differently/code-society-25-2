# Supplemental 9: Design Interviews ([Slides](https://code-differently.github.io/code-society-25-2/slides/#/supplemental_9))

## Overview

This lesson prepares you for design interviews, a critical component of software engineering interviews. We'll cover both coding design (object-oriented design) and system design (distributed systems) interviews, providing you with frameworks and strategies to excel.

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with a basic design, then add complexity
2. **Consider Tradeoffs**: Discuss pros and cons of different approaches
3. **Think About Scale**: How does your design handle 10x, 100x, 1000x growth?
4. **Don't Over-engineer**: Match the solution to the problem scope
5. **Be Honest**: If you don't know something, say so and explain how you'd learn it
6. **Manage Time**: Don't get stuck on one component; cover all major parts
7. **Stay Calm**: Design interviews are collaborative, not adversarial

Remember: The interviewer wants to see your thought process, not just the final answer. Communication and reasoning are as important as technical correctness.
