## Explanation

The languages used for the assignment are Python and JavaScript. In order to determine whether or not a number is prime, the functions used for both the Python implementation and the JavaScript implementation needed to meet the following criteria:

- If the number is less than 2, it is not prime.
- If the number is 2, it is prime.
- If the number can be evenly divided by 2 (i.e. the remainder of the division of the number by 2 equals 0), it is not prime.
- If the number is greater than 2 and can be evenly divided by any number from 2 up to the square root of the number, it is not prime.
- If the number can NOT be evenly divided by any number from 2 up to the square root of the number, it is prime.

### Other Similarities
- In both Python and JavaScript, `i` is used to represent the numbers being tested as divisors. 

### Differences
- #### Syntax:
    - In Python, the function is defined using the `def` keyword, while the `function` keyword is used in JavaScript.
    - In Python, the `==` is used as the equality operator, while `===` is used as the equality operator in JavaScript. 
    - In Python the `True` and `False` are used for boolean values, while JavaScript uses `true` and `false`.
    - In Python the equation for square root is represented by `n**0.5`, while Python represents it by `Math.sqrt(n)`.
