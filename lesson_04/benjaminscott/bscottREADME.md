# Introduction
For this assignment, I chose to make my prime number functions in Python and C#. I chose these languages becaue they are two languages that I have the most experience with. After making them, I've noticed many similatries and differences.
## Similarities
 - Both implementations use for loops to check if the number was a prime.
 - Both functions use "number" as the input of the function.
 - Both handle edge cases by checking if number â‰¤ 1.
 - Both return a boolean value.
 - Both return false if number % i and is equal to 0.
## Differences
 - C# uses more optimized approach by explicitly handling even numbers and only checking odd divisors.
 - Python checks all numbers up to the square root. 
 - C# requires more explicit syntax with type declarations and a class structure, while Python's implementation is simpler. 
 - C# uses Math.Sqrt() for calculating the square root while Python uses the power operator (**). 
 - C# version includes additional optimizations like checking for even numbers separately and only testing odd divisors.
